Overview of The Project
_____________

- Project : Creat Database and implement different joins to combine data from multiple tables . 

- Objective :                                      
The objective of creating a database and using joins is to organize data well, keep it accurate, reduce duplication, and make it easy to combine information from different tables for better insights.
 This allows for effective data retrieval and analysis, supporting informed decision-making and enhancing overall operational efficiency.




- JOINS :                      
Here are the different types of joins commonly used in databases:                        
1 . Inner Join: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.                                                                             
2 . Left Join (Left Outer Join): Returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. If there’s no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.                                                       
3 . Right Join (Right Outer Join): Returns all rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. If there’s no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.                                                                       
4 . Full Join (Full Outer Join): Returns all rows when there’s a match in either the left or right table. If there’s no match, NULL values are returned for the non-matching side.

- Technologies Used :

- Conclusion :                                                           
In conclusion, creating a database and using joins is important for organizing and managing data effectively. It helps keep information accurate, reduces duplication, and makes it easier to access related data. This leads to better insights and supports informed decision-making, making it a valuable tool for any organization.
